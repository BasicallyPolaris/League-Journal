# Review of 13. Jan. 2023
---
# [[Syndra]] vs [[Sylas]]
1. low cs numbers 
	- Aggressive playstyle $\leadsto$ Low CSPM
	- Got to refine [[last hitting]]
	- Lack of [[wave management]]
2. First death too greedy, respect their [[win condition]]s (Bard roam + Karma)
	- Think about win conditions for both team ahead of game start  
4. No usage of [[lull state]]s (e.g. walking to lane, timing summoners but not looking at map $\Rightarrow$ Whats more important ?)
	-  Use lull state to time summoners and look at map / sidelanes at the same time, make it use less mental stack
5. Need to [[ping]] more actively
### $\Rightarrow$ No game plan / lack of [[win condition]] analysis $\Leftarrow$
# [[Karma]] vs [[Talon]]
1. Good agressivity, low cpsm + small missplay
   - Refine [[last hitting]] + [[aggressive playstyle]]
2. Too much time on lane 
   -  Bad [[reset timing]]s $\Rightarrow$ Good roams for enemy + high time for me on lane!
3. Need to [[ping]] more actively
4. Need to consider [[tempo]] more actively
5.  Too late adaptation to their win condition $\leadsto$ Wrong itemization $\leadsto$ worse midgame
### $\Rightarrow$ Bad [[reset timing]]s + lack of [[win condition]] assessment $\Leftarrow$ 
---
# [[Ryze]] vs [[Twisted Fate]]
1. Lack of [[jungle tracking]] $\leadsto$ failed threat assesment when tf had stuncard **@3:30**
   (We knew from a Ward that Udyr started topside!)
2. Lack of laning plan, pushing without clear vision, not looking on sidelanes 
3. Low intensity gameplay, hard shove every wave, not taking into consideration levels
### $\Rightarrow$ Low [[intensity]] + bad [[jungle tracking]] $\Leftarrow$
# [[Ryze]] vs [[Veigar]]
1. After invade **@2:10** $\Rightarrow$ Need to secure [[tempo]] to deny Graves from reinvading Kindred on topside
2. **@3:30** $\Rightarrow$ Secure push / deny veigar from getting high quality reset! You have a lead by being reset! Way too defensive posturing $\leadsto$ bad wavestate, should've held wave
3. **@7:50** Ping away Kindred from Herald OR don't reset!
4. **@8:30** I know topside play is coming $\Rightarrow$ MOVE TOPSIDE INSTEAD OF BOTLANE! 
   $\leadsto$ Wasted a lot of time midlane instead of maybe getting an important play done toplane OR at least go bot to force dive & turret.
