# League-Journal
Basic Obsidian Vault Template used for League of Legends journals.

There are already some Template-pages for champions and a preview of how a "Learning Objective entry" / "VOD Analysis" entry could look like.

# How to use

## Getting the required files
1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for your Operating System
2. Acquire the needed files:

   - Clone this project into a folder of your choice via command line (requires [git](https://git-scm.com/))
      ```zsh
         git clone https://github.com/BasicallyPolaris/League-Journal.git
      ```
   - OR: Press "Code" in the top left of the UI on the [Github Page](https://github.com/BasicallyPolaris/League-Doc) and then "Download ZIP" and then unpack it into your desired Vault-Folder
   - OR: Go to [Releases](https://github.com/BasicallyPolaris/League-Journal/releases) and download the most recent release as a ZIP and then unpack it into your desired Vault-Folder


## Using the templates
1. Open the cloned folder via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a "**Vault**"
2. Now when writing a note press `<CTRL> + <ALT> + T` to pick a Template after creating a new file

## Naming scheme
I highly advise to name the VOD-Analysis Files in the **format** of `YYYY.MM.DD` as this results in a right ordering of your reviews in the file explorer and in obsidian.
