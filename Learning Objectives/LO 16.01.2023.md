# Learning Objectives from 16 Jan 2023
---
1. [[jungle tracking]] needs to improve
   $\Rightarrow$ **Look at map when the jungle spawns**
2. Emphasis on [[win condition]] assessment and **playing around it** 
3. **Slow down mental pace**, focus on *the details*
---
### What went well:
1. Keep up [[aggressive playstyle]], while still focusing on [[wave management]]!
---
### Might add later:
3. [[Ward]]ing times need to improve as well (can put aside for now)
